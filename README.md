# Terraform module for AWS CloudTrail with CloudWatch Alarms and an SNS Topic

This terraform module will create an AWS CloudTrail which is configured with an S3 bucket and which also streams logs to a CloudWatch Log Group. Eleven CloudWatch alarms are created with alarm notifications sent to a created SNS Topic.

**Remember to subscribe to the SNS Topic**

## Module Input Variables

* `region` - The AWS region where the resources are to be created
* `cloudtrail_name` - Specifies the name of the cloudtrail
* `cloudwatch_log_group` - The name of the created Log Group
* `sns_topic` - The friendly name for the created SNS topic
* `bucket_name` - The name of the S3 bucket used by CloudTrail

```
module "cloudtrail" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/david-wells-1/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-with-alarms-and-sns.git"

  region                     = var.region
